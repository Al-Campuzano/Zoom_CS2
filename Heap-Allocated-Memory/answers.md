Question 1
Consider the difference between statically and dynamically allocated memory.

- How can you tell in code that a value is being stored on the stack?
  Value that is stored on the stack does not use the "new" keyword
- When does the memory for a variable on the stack get deleted?
  It gets deleted when the function where the variable was declared/used stops running and is removed from the stack.
- Similarly, how can you tell in code that a value is being stored on the heap?
  Values being stored on the heap are initialized using the "new" keyword
- When does memory for a value on the heap get deleted?
  When you use the "delete" keyword
