What types of input could break your program?
  The way i set this up would only count separate words if there is a space between them, so if you typed two words with a symbol between them instead of a space they will be counted as one word. Like this:

  ```
    Type something: one-long,word,with-no!spaces?
    Total words: 1
    Longest word length: 23
    Most vowels amount: 8
  ```

What if someone presses enter right away?
  No problem

  ```
    Type something:
    Total words: 0
    Longest word length: 0
    Most vowels amount: 0
  ```

What if there’s only one word?
  It works fine :)

  ```
    Type something: One
    Total words: 1
    Longest word length: 3
    Most vowels amount: 2
  ```

What if there are many words?
  Taken care of

  ```
    Type something: What if there are many many many words in here?
    Total words: 10
    Longest word length: 5
    Most vowels amount: 2
  ```

What if there are multiple spaces between words?
  No sweat

  ```
    Type something: Come        back    here!
    Total words: 3
    Longest word length: 4
    Most vowels amount: 2
  ```

etc… Make sure it all works.
  I _think_ this should work fine in all cases :crossedfingers:
